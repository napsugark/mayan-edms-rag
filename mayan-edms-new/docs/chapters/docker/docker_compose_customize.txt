Customization

  .. important::

      Only change the file ``docker-compose.yml`` if you experience with
      Docker Compose files, YAML and Mayan EDMS.


#. Update the Mayan EDMS Docker Compose file:

   Update the ``docker-compose.yml`` file directly or the ``.env`` in the
   same folder where the file ``docker-compose.yml`` resides.
   Add an entry for each of the environment variables to change.

   .. note::

       If the ``.env`` file does not reside in the same folder where the
       ``docker-compose.yml`` is or you choose another filename for it,
       the option ``--env-file <you env file path>`` needs to be added
       to every ``docker compose`` invocation.


#. Verify the configuration changes:

   .. code-block:: console

       docker compose --file docker-compose.yml --project-name mayan config

   This command will output the Docker Compose file, using the values of your
   ``.env`` file.
