Support status
==============

Software support levels determine the type and extent of assistance a release series receives throughout its lifecycle. The level of support depends on the age of the series and whether it falls under community or commercial support.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Software support levels define the scope of assistance and maintenance
provided. These levels vary based on the age of the software series. The
following table outlines the support levels for major software series."
=======
Below are the support levels for major release series, starting from the most recent.


Support levels
==============


Fully Supported
---------------


A **fully supported** series receives the highest level of attention:

- Technical assistance is available to resolve issues.
- Security vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
- Frequent bug-fix releases are issued.
- New features and enhancements are added.
- Translations are actively maintained.

This level ensures both innovation and stability for production use.


Maintenance
-----------

A **maintenance** series remains supported but with reduced scope:

- Only severe bugs and security issues are addressed.
- No new features or major updates are added.
- Compatibility with the newest platforms or dependencies is not guaranteed.
- Translations continue to be updated.
- Technical support is limited.

This is the final phase before a series reaches *end of life*.


Extended Support
----------------

A **series in extended support** is comparable to a **Long Term Support (LTS)** release, but it is **available only to paying customers**.

- Security patches and critical bug fixes are provided on request.
- Fixes may be backported to older versions under a commercial agreement.
- Community support is no longer available.
- New releases may no be available to the public.
- Translations are not maintained.

Extended support allows organizations to remain on a stable version for longer, while still receiving essential updates under a sponsored or commercial support contract.


End of Life
-----------

When a series reaches **end of life (EOL)**, all regular support ends:

- No security patches or bug fixes are released.
- The series will likely be incompatible with newer technologies.
- Translations are removed from Transifex and frozen in the code repository.

Only under exceptional circumstances will a new release of an EOL series be made.
